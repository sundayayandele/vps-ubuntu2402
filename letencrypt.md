sudo apt update &&
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache && 
sudo certbot certonly --webserver apache -d itgiving.com
nano /etc/crontab

Add the following line to the file, replacing <your_email> with your email address:

0 0 1 * *   root certbot renew >> /var/log/letsencrypt/renewal.log

 Configure Apache for Webmin with SSL:

Edit the default Apache configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf
Enable SSL module and virtual host:

Uncomment the following lines in the configuration file:

Apache
# SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/webmin.crt
# SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/webmin.key

# Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf
# Include /etc/letsencrypt/sites-available/<your_domain_name>.conf
Use code with caution.

Replace the commented-out lines with the actual paths to your Let's Encrypt certificate and key files generated by Certbot (typically located in /etc/letsencrypt/live/<your_domain_name>/).

Enable the default SSL site:

sudo a2ensite default-ssl.conf
5. Restart Apache:

sudo systemctl restart apache2
6. Access Webmin with HTTPS:

Open your web browser and access Webmin using https://<your_domain_name>:10000. Your browser might initially display a warning about the certificate (because it's new). If you trust the certificate (issued by Let's Encrypt), you can proceed to access the secure Webmin interface.

Additional Notes:

Consider using a tool like certbot certificates to verify the installation and location of your Let's Encrypt certificates.
Remember to keep your system and Webmin software updated for security.
Further Considerations:

While Webmin itself doesn't directly integrate with Let's Encrypt, using Certbot offers a widely used and automated solution.
If you're using Virtualmin with Webmin, it might offer a more integrated Let's Encrypt management solution within its interface. Refer to Virtualmin documentation for details: https://archive.virtualmin.com/comment/770550
By following these steps, you should be able to configure Webmin on Ubuntu to use Let's Encrypt for HTTPS, providing a secure connection to your web-based server management tool.
